# Network Connectivity Issue Fix

## Problem
The app was redirecting users to the login screen whenever there was no or low internet connectivity, even when they had valid cached attendance data available locally.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `checkAndAutoLogin()` method in `AttendanceProvider`. When network connectivity was poor or unavailable:

1. The method would attempt to auto-login with saved credentials
2. If the network request failed (catch block), it would automatically call `_clearLoginCredentials()`
3. This would clear the user's login state and saved credentials
4. The splash screen logic would then redirect to login screen due to the cleared login state

## Solution
Modified the `checkAndAutoLogin()` method to be more resilient to network failures:

### Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling in Auto-Login** (`lib/providers/attendance_provider.dart`):
   - Before clearing credentials on network failure, check if cached data is available
   - If cached data exists, preserve credentials and set offline mode message
   - Only clear credentials if no cached data is available
   - Return `true` when using cached data to indicate successful authentication state

2. **Improved App Lifecycle Observer** (`lib/main.dart`):
   - Added additional check for `collegeId` before attempting refresh
   - More robust condition to prevent unnecessary refresh attempts

3. **Better User Messaging**:
   - Clear offline mode indicator: "Offline mode - showing cached data. Pull to refresh when connected."
   - Users understand they're in offline mode and know how to refresh

### Technical Details:

#### Before Fix:
```dart
} catch (e) {
  await _clearLoginCredentials();  // Always cleared credentials on error
  _isLoading = false;
  notifyListeners();
  return false;
}
```

#### After Fix:
```dart
} catch (e) {
  debugPrint('Auto-login network error: $e');
  // Network error - check if we have cached data before clearing credentials
  await _loadOfflineAttendance();
  if (_attendanceList.isNotEmpty && _isLoggedIn) {
    // We have valid cached data, don't clear credentials
    _collegeId = savedCredentials['collegeId'];
    _password = savedCredentials['password'];
    _error = 'Offline mode - showing cached data. Pull to refresh when connected.';
    _isLoading = false;
    notifyListeners();
    return true;  // Return true to indicate successful authentication
  } else {
    // No cached data available, clear credentials
    await _clearLoginCredentials();
    _isLoading = false;
    notifyListeners();
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix:

1. **With Network Available**: Normal auto-login and data refresh
2. **With Poor Network**: 
   - Auto-login may fail but cached data is preserved
   - User stays authenticated with offline data
   - Can manually refresh when connectivity improves
3. **No Network at All**:
   - App gracefully falls back to cached data
   - User remains logged in with offline attendance data
   - Clear indication of offline mode

## Testing Scenarios:

1. **Test Offline Mode**:
   - Login with network
   - Turn off network/airplane mode
   - Restart app
   - Should show cached data, not redirect to login

2. **Test Poor Network**:
   - Login with good network
   - Simulate slow/unstable network
   - Restart app
   - Should gracefully handle network errors and show cached data

3. **Test Network Recovery**:
   - Start in offline mode with cached data
   - Enable network
   - Pull to refresh
   - Should fetch fresh data

## Files Modified:
- `lib/providers/attendance_provider.dart`
- `lib/main.dart`

## Impact:
- No more forced logout on network issues
- Better offline experience
- Preserved user data and authentication state
- Improved user experience during poor connectivity
