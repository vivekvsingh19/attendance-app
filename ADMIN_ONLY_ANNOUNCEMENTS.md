3. **App automatically syncs** announcements across all devices
4. **Users only view** announcements - no editing capabilities

### 📊 **Google Sheets Format:**
```
Column A: ID (1, 2, 3...)
Column B: Title (Welcome!, Important Notice, etc.)
Column C: Content (Full announcement text)
Column D: Date (8/22/2025 format)
Column E: Important (true/false)
```

### 🌐 **Cross-Device Sync:**
- All devices automatically get your announcements
- No Firebase complexity - just Google Sheets
- Offline support with local caching
- Error handling for network issues

## 🚀 **Ready to Use:**
Your announcement system is now **admin-only** and **minimal** as requested. Users can only view announcements that you publish through Google Sheets. The UI is clean and subtle, fitting naturally into your attendance app.
